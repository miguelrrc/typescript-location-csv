This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


Project created with TypeScript.

It is a very basic project that will fetch some properties from the API and show them.

The user can click on any of the rows rendered and it will show properties inside the bounding box (0.1 km). It will also show the average price/sqm and the average living area/sqm.
